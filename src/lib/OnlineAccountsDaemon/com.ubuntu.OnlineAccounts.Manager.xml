      Global concepts:

      Clients are identified by their "applicationId", which is the
      "<package>_<app>" of the client.

      The "serviceId" is an application-specific name for an account provider.
      That is, the "serviceId" contains the information about the application
      which will use it, and the account provider (e.g. "google", "facebook").
      "serviceId"s are backed by files shipped with the application, which can
      contain application/account-provider specific information, such as the
      ClientId and ClientSecret to be used when authentication with OAuth 2.0. 
      An application can ship more than one "serviceId", if they refer to
      different account providers; that is, one application can have a
      serviceId for Google and one for Facebook, but the same application
      cannot have one for GMail and another for Picasa.

      Allowed keys for the "filters" parameter (any combination is allowed,

      - "serviceId" ("s"): if the application wants to list only those
        accounts coming from a specific provider (e.g., "Facebook").

      - "accountId" ("u"): the ID of an account.

      In any case, an application will receive only those accounts which the
      user has authorized the application to use. See
        http://wiki.ubuntu.com/OnlineAccounts

        This dictionary can be used to specify OAuth client keys or permission
        scopes. While it's possible to statically define them a the "serviceId"
        level, some apps might want to change this information at runtime.
        Possible use cases:
        1) OAuth keys are retrieved from a server (so that they can be updated
           when the old ones are revoked).
        2) An app might want to use different keys when talking to GMail and
           Picasa.
        3) The scope list can also be dynamic, and depending on how the user is
           using the app.
        4) SASL: the parameters would contain the latest challenge got from the
           server.
